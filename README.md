===============

Independent Web App to interact with Code Hero

## Installation

### Install NodeJS
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed in your machine.

### Clone the project
... obviously.
```
git clone git@github.com:sheniff/codehero-webapp.git
```

### Install node dependencies
```
npm install
```
It will install grunt-cli, bower, yo and all the other node dependencies

### Use bower to install app dependencies
```
bower install
```

### Run grunt to test the app and start a dev server
```
grunt test
grunt server
```
You can also run just `grunt` to generate the compiled project in `dist` folder. Still not sure if it works properly...
